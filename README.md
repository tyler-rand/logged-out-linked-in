# logged-out-linked-in

A simple browser extension which helps with browsing a few LinkedIn profiles while not logged in.

### Why

When browsing LinkedIn while not logged in, you're allowed a few searches before you hit the "authwall" and are redirected to a login page. Prior to the hitting the authwall, you're shown previews of profiles with an unclosable popup modal and scrolling disabled on the page. 

This little extension removes the modal and re-enables scrolling, allowing a few extra profile views without being logged in.
